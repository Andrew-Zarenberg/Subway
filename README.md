# Subway
A simulation of the NYC Subway system.

Using the HTML5 canvas, the subway tracks beneath the streets of New York City are shown.  (Data taken from track maps found at  http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway_Track_Maps).

Clicking on one of the number/letter buttons on the bottom will spawn a train in the selected direction at the beginning of the line.  The train will then continue along the track while stopping at all stations.  The train will automatically switch tracks in order to follow its route.  (For example, downtown E and M trains will start on the same track, but the M will automatically switch to 6th Avenue while the E will continue to 8th Avenue.)

Not all tracks have been added in yet.
